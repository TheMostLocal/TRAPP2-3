TRAPP2 — Phase 3: Regime Classifier + State Object writer.

Reads signal scores from compute_signals.py, classifies the current regime via
a soft-vote classifier (6 ideal-score profiles, sum-of-squares distance, softmax),
and writes:
  data/regime_current.json   — today's snapshot (the "brain")
  data/regime_history.json   — append-only daily history (Markov input)

In Phase 4 (compute_transitions.py), once regime_history has ~60 rows, the Markov
transition matrix will be computed and attached to regime_current.

Regime definitions:
  expansion        — broad bullish, growth + risk-on + low vol
  risk_on_melt_up  — extreme positive momentum
  inflation_shock  — macro weak, vol elevated, valuation hit
  recession_fear   — growth crashing, liquidity tight, defensive
  risk_off         — flight-to-quality, vol elevated
  neutral          — no dominant signal
